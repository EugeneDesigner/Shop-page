# Website


I decided to create website using React+Redux stack. Shop items are loaded through props, and the website is ready for scaling with all the structure built around reusable components.

* React
* Redux
* Webpack
* CSS modules
* React Router
* Express


### Heroku

I also posted website on [Heroku](https://obscure-atoll-40915.herokuapp.com/catalog), check it out
